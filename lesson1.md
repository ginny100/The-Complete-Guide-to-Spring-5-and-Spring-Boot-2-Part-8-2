# Lesson 1: Stubbing and Mocking

## Overview

In unit testing, we should be able to test every application layer _independently_. A test for the service layer should not be dependent on the data layer. 

We use __stubbing__ and __mocking__ to test a part of our application by mocking an external service or an application layer. There are different mocking frameworks available like `Mockito`, `JMock`, and `EasyMock`.
